32. Terraform Modules
Modules are used to organise our terraform configurations and resuse them.

35. Terraform Module Scopes
In terraform, we can access some variables outside of the module by using output block, but 1 thing to be noted here, only those variables which are returned by our module.

36. Terraform Modules - Public Registry
We can access info about all Terraform Modules from public repository which is present at registry.terraform.io.
Here, we can get all info about the terraform modules.
We can also create our own module here but need to follow some conventions.
